1) What is the “size” of this relationship? In your own words, what does this mean? Does this match what you observed in your plots in step 2.1?
The size of this relationship is 0.3776, meaning that as the Fathers age increases, so does the number of de Novo Mutations to a degree of 0.38 per year, with a p-value of 6.878208e-24. This does match what I have seen in the plot as there appears to be a trend of de Novo Mutations increasing as the Fathers age increases. 

2) Is this relationship significant? How do you know?
This relationship is significant according to the p-value of 6.878208e-24. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis that Fathers age and de Novo Mutations have no relationship

1) What is the “size” of this relationship? In your own words, what does this mean? Does this match what you observed in your plots in step 2.1?
The size of this relationship is 1.3538, meaning that as the Fathers age increases, so does the number of de Novo Mutations to a degree of 1.35 per year, with a p-value of 1.552294e-84. This does match what I have seen in the plot as there appears to be a trend of de Novo Mutations increasing as the Fathers age increases. 

2) Is this relationship significant? How do you know?
This relationship is significant according to the p-value of 1.552294e-84. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis that Fathers age and de Novo Mutations have no relationship

y = mx + b
m = 1.35
b = 10.3263 (coefficient of the Intercept)

y = 1.35 (50.5) + 10.3263
y = DNM = 78.7

# 2.6
1) What statistical test did you choose? Why?
A t-test to compare the difference in mean between paternal DNM and maternal DNM across the proband IDs

2) Was your test result statistically significant? Interpret your result as it relates to the number of paternally and maternally inherited DNMs.
The test was staistically significant, it returned a p-value of pvalue=2.198603179308129e-264. I interpret this as meaning that paternal DNMs occur statistically significantly more than maternal DNMs. Meaning, paternally inherited chromosomes contatining DNMs are inherited more often (to a significant degree) than from mothers.
