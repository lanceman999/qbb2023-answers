# QUESTION 1.1
1) How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?
1Mbp x 3 = 3Mbp
3Mbp / 100bp = 30Kbp

# QUESTION 1.3
1) In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
In the simulation, there are 53222 bases with 0 coverage, which is 5.3222% of the genome

2) How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
This matches poisson expectations quite well, normal distribution does not fit the data very well.


# QUESTION 1.4
1) In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
In the simulation there are 165 bases with 0 coverage, which is 0.0165% of the genome

2) How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
The distribution matches Poisson very well, and the normal distribution does not fit the data very well. However, the normal distribution fits the data much better when compared to the distribution from 3x coverage


# QUESTION 1.5
1) In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
In the simulation there are 5 bases with 0 coverage, whcih is 0.0005% of the genome

2) How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
Given the large covereage, both the poisson and normal distribtuion fit very well! The poisson fits a tiny bit better than the normal dist, but they are almost the same.

ATT occurs 4 times

TCATT(1)GATT(2)CATT(3)CTTATT(4)T

# QUESTION 2.6
The entire genome? Firstly, we would need much longer reads, and much longer k-mers than 3. It would also be import to have expression data to get a better understanding of where in the chromosomes highly expressed genes are for confirmational purposes, as well as insight into specific k-mer frequency.

Output:
Title: The Fascination of Genomics: Exploring the Basis of Evolution, Genetic Diversity, Diseases, and Protein Expression

Introduction

Genomics, the study of an organism's entire genetic makeup, is a field that has captivated my interest for a multitude of reasons. Genomics serves as the cornerstone of biological sciences, shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms that underlie evolution, genetic diversity, the origins of diseases, and the intricate processes governing protein expression. This essay aims to explore the myriad facets of genomics that make it such an enthralling and indispensable area of study.

Genomics: Unraveling the Code of Life

Genomics allows us to delve deep into the genetic code that defines all living organisms. Understanding this code is like deciphering the ancient script of life itself. Through the study of genomes, we can trace the evolutionary journey of species, unraveling the intricate relationships between different life forms. Genomics has provided crucial insights into the common ancestry of all living organisms, revealing our shared genetic heritage and the mechanisms by which diversity arises within the tree of life.

Genetic Diversity and Human Evolution

The human genome, composed of over three billion DNA base pairs, offers a window into our evolutionary history. Through genomics, we can explore the genetic diversity that has shaped our species over millennia. It enables us to uncover the genetic adaptations that allowed early humans to thrive in diverse environments and adapt to changing circumstances. Genomic studies have also illuminated the genetic contributions of archaic hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, to the modern human genome, providing insights into our complex evolutionary story.

Genomics and Disease: From Diagnosis to Treatment

One of the most compelling aspects of genomics is its role in unravelling the genetic basis of diseases. By sequencing and analyzing the genomes of individuals and populations, researchers can identify genetic variants associated with diseases ranging from rare genetic disorders to complex conditions like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This knowledge has opened the door to personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup. Furthermore, genomics has revolutionized the field of genetic counseling, helping individuals make informed decisions about their health based on their genetic predispositions.

Protein Expression and Functional Genomics

Understanding genomics is not limited to deciphering the DNA code alone. It also encompasses the study of how genes are transcribed and translated into proteinsâ€”the essential molecules that carry out the majority of cellular functions. Genomics has given rise to the field of functional genomics, which investigates the roles of individual genes and their protein products. This knowledge has far-reaching implications, from advancing our understanding of cellular processes to enabling the development of targeted therapies.

Conclusion

In conclusion, genomics is a captivating and indispensable field that has the potential to transform our understanding of life, evolution, genetic diversity, diseases, and the intricate mechanisms governing protein expression. As we continue to unlock the secrets encoded within genomes, the impact of genomics on biology, medicine, and our broader understanding of the natural world is bound to be profound. My interest in genomics stems from its power to answer fundamental questions about life and its potential to drive innovative solutions in healthcare and beyond. Genomics is not just a scientific discipline; it is a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity and our quest to comprehend the intricacies of existence itself.


# QUESTION 3.2
I feel that the output makes sense - I think that it is fairly dramatic and broad, but overall gets the message across that I prompted it to. 
Some sentences that I definitley would never write: 
 - This essay aims to explore the myriad facets of genomics that make it such an enthralling and indispensable area of study.
 - Understanding this code is like deciphering the ancient script of life itself.

does not appear to exist!!!

They cite a textbook "Molecular Biology of the Cell" which is extremely broad and doesn't give any insight to what information they drew from that textbook.....s

This article "Complete Khoisan and Bantu genomes from southern Africa" does not make sense to me as to why they cited it.... It is very specific and the only information I could imagine that they took was from the Introduction or Discussion
