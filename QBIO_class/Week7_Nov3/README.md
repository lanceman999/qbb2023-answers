# WEEK 7 QUESTIONS:

1) Are the majority of the CpG dinucleotides methylated or unmethylated?
Methylated

# 3A)
    ONT unique reads: 53346 (1.2263482106157535)%
    Bisulfite unique reads: 132466 (2.9908053720974968)%
    Shared sites: 4296642 (48.941736142308955)% 

2) How does using nanopore for methylation calling differ from bisulfite sequencing in terms of coverage? Which method appears better and why?
Bisulfite has better coveage - more reads have higher coverage

3) What can you infer about the two different approaches and their ability to detect methylation changes? 
ONT can detect more changes

4) What is the effect of tumorigenesis on global methylation patterns?
it changes epigenetic landscape altering the gene expression due to methylation 

5) What changes can you observe between the normal and tumor methylation landscape? What do you think the possible effects are of the changes you observed?
more methylation in tumore - changes in gene expression in tumore samples due to methylation

6) What does it mean for a gene to be “imprinted”?
when it falls in love with a werewolf #teamjacob

7) What is happening when you select the option to phase the reads? What is required in order to phase the reads?
it won't cluster

8) Can any set of reads be phased? Explain your answer.
it won't cluster
